            NextHost is a service created to manage hostnames. Hostnames are tracked via patterns that exist under projects
            that are owned by owners. Hostname, Pattern, Project, and Owner entries are unique. Owners can own multiple
            projects, and projects can have multiple patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hostnames are added automatically when a new pattern is created. The pattern parameters determine the
            format of the hostnames. When initially created, hostnames have a status of 'available.' A hostname
            can have a status available, reserved, assigned, or expired. Status for a hostname can be changed via RESTful API
            or via web interface. Full roll based access controls limits changes to applicable owners and admins.
            </p>
            <p>
            NextHost includes views and APIs to show hostnames of any or all status by pattern, project, or owner.
            </p>
            <p>
            example: An owner, named ops, has a project named redis. This project has three patterns:
                <span class="font-italic text-info">aws_redis_(\d[3])</span>, <span class="font-italic text-info">azr_redis_(\d[3])</span>, and <span class="font-italic text-info">gcp_redis_(\d[3])</span>, with each pattern allowing upto ten hosts. Hostnames
            for this project would include: aws_redis_001, aws_redis_002, aws_redis_003, azr_redis_001, azr_redis_002, azr_redis_003,
            gcp_redis_001, gcp_redis_002, gcp_redis_003, etc.
